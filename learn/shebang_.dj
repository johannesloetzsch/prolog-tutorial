# Shebang

You can start your prolog scripts with a [shebang-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix%29). This makes them runable without specifying the interpreter.

This repo contains an [example](../shebang.html) inspired from [here](https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog/issues/2170#issuecomment-1821713993):

```sh
./src/shebang.pl 
```
```
hello
```
